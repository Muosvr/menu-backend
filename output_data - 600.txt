smoo
here at smoq we believe in doing bbq the old fashioned way over wood low n slow our process results
in meat that has bark a dark rich sweet chewy crust depending on the meat and how long its on the smoker
the bark can range in color from a deep mahogany red to molasses black it is not burnt or overcooked it is
part of what makes our bbq great our smoking process produces just below the bark a red smoke ring
the smoke ring is not an indication of undercooking it is a chemical reaction between the smoke  meat
all of our meats are prepared in a way true to our southern tradition and are authentically good enjoy

already sold  slices since october
lazy pie tinginysin  a lithuanian woman accidentally created the recipe she tried to cook
chocolate but added too much sugar which liquefied the mixture into syrup to remedy this the woman tried to
make the savor less strong by adding some biscuits so she broke them into pieces mixed them with syrup and
when it cooled the first tinginys was created later modifications occurred such as letting the mixture cool
down and rolling it on a plastic bag and then cutting it into pieces people decided to call it lazy because it was
very easy and quick to prepare

the round up
all the chip thats fit to print
it all started in  as a  sq ft beer and bait stop on the way to bartlett lake its grown a lot over the years  sq ft indoors and  acres of
outdoor venues with seating for up to  people an arson fire in  burned the chip to the ground but it was completely rebuilt with lumber
and findings from an antique sawmill in california ten months later the chip you see today was reborn from the ashes we never closed during the
construction people wonder about the green bay packer connection at the buffalo chip it was born out of the original ownership of the chip by the
legendary green bay packer tight end max mcgee from
it was then purchased by larry wendt the current owner since that time the buffalo chip has become one of the biggest and busiest western eating
drinking and entertainment venues in the country we have live entertainment  days a week award winning barbque and the best staff in cave
creek we serve ice cold drinks at a fair price and strive to give you our friends and customers the best value in the country as larry often says

xicaru reposado mezcal
using his grandmothers recipe fernando santibanez makes small batches of xicaru mezcal with time honored
methods in oaxaca mexico using  tahona mashed agave espadin xicaru reposado is aged naturally and gently
for four months using medium toasted american oak barrels
tasting notes colors or light straw and aromas of traditional smoky mezcal with delicate vanilla complimented by
caramel on the palate there is an intensity that is softened by the sweetness of honey and vanilla and a multifaceted
mouthfeel that lingers with a lasting finish
dukes waikiki is proud to offer paper straws upon request as part of our efforts
to ensure that our ocean and our aina stay healthy for future generations

the story of arepa mia
this story as most do begins with my mother and food the name arepa mia is about
my heart my arepas and my mom
in venezuela my mother made arepas on the streets for more than  years as a
young child i helped her as much as i could along the way i learned more and more about
the business and she taught me many recipes we would go to the arepa stand every day and
sell the arepas that we had made in our home
when we strolled through the market picking out fresh veggie and meats i soon
realized how much i enjoyed the process of cooking
as a teenager i decided that cooking was my passion and that i wanted to share my
gift when i moved to america i knew immediately that i wanted to bring the traditional
cuisine of my home country here
i moved to new orleans in  and eventually ended up in atlanta starting arepa mia
through the atlanta underground market in  to me arepa mia is about simple comfort
simple love and simple food when i call my mom back home in venezuela and tell here that
people here love her arepas she just cant believe it
thank you to everyone especially close friends and family for supporting and be
lieving in the dream of arepa mia  lis
